Three.js Iframe
This project demonstrates how to integrate Three.js (a 3D graphics library) into an iframe for embedding interactive 3D content into web pages.

Overview
This repository contains a simple example of using Three.js within an iframe. The main purpose is to showcase how to build and embed 3D graphics using Three.js in a contained iframe environment.

Technologies Used
Three.js: A popular JavaScript library used for creating and displaying 3D computer graphics in web browsers.
HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
CSS: Used for styling the HTML elements within the project.
